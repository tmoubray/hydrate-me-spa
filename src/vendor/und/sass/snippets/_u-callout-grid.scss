/**
 * Callout Grid Snippet
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * OU Name:        [Program] Callout Grid
 * Table Label:    Callout Grid
 * Table Selector: .ou-snippet-callout-grid, .ou-snippet-program-grid
 *
 * This snippet has the potential to be shifted to universal usage, thus,
 * renamed to reflect that.
 *
 * Just weeks ago, during the Program Page Refresh update, we renamed the
 * snippet to better match scoping and naming conventions. Since then, further
 * refinements require a second name change. As the second iteration has been in
 * use for a few weeks, we need to leave it in place until all those pages are
 * republished.
 *
 * Once all deprecated naming is no longer in use (verify via
 * SiteImprove), remove those names from this file and others, i.e.
 * `_component-themes.scss`.
